# Content

Place all of your site's planned content here for now. You'll later move it to your website in a future milestone.

Text should be written and stored as Markdown files in the "content" folder. (This file is a Markdown file. You may use it if you wish.)

Media (i.e. images) content should also be stored in the "m1-content" folder.
